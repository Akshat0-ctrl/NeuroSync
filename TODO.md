# Task: Replace Public Folder Elements with Experimental Elements and Update Backend Connections

## Steps

1. Replace `public/index.html` with `Experimental_pages/exp_index.html`
   - Update internal links to point to public folder files (e.g., `Exp_Login.html` to `login page.html`).

2. Replace `public/login page.html` and `public/sign-in page.html` with `Experimental_pages/Exp_Login.html`
   - Update redirects and links to point to `student-planner.html` or appropriate public folder files.

3. Replace `public/student-planner.html` with `Experimental_pages/Exp_dashboard_home.html`
   - Update internal navigation links accordingly.

4. Review and update other public folder files (e.g., `mood-selection.html`) if needed to align with experimental design.

5. Ensure Firebase configuration is consistent across all replaced files.

6. Test the authentication flow and navigation to verify backend integration.
