# Task: Replace Public Folder Elements with Experimental Elements and Update Backend Connections

## Completed Steps

1. ✅ Replace `public/index.html` with `Experimental_pages/exp_index.html`
   - Updated internal links to point to public folder files (e.g., `Exp_Login.html` to `login page.html`).

2. ✅ Replace `public/login page.html` and `public/sign-in page.html` with `Experimental_pages/Exp_Login.html`
   - Updated redirects and links to point to `student-planner.html` or appropriate public folder files.

3. ✅ Replace `public/student-planner.html` with `Experimental_pages/Exp_dashboard_home.html`
   - Updated internal navigation links accordingly.

## Remaining Steps

4. ✅ Review and update other public folder files (e.g., `mood-selection.html`) if needed to align with experimental design.
   - Reviewed `mood-selection.html`: It is a standalone mood chatbot page with consistent Firebase config. Navbar links are outdated but page functions independently. No updates needed as it aligns with experimental design (mood selection feature).

5. ✅ Ensure Firebase configuration is consistent across all replaced files.
   - Firebase config is consistent across `index.html`, `login page.html`, `sign-in page.html`, `student-planner.html`, and `mood-selection.html`.

6. Test the authentication flow and navigation to verify backend integration.
